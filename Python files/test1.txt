Data at Rest It includes scanning of storage and other content repositories to identify where sensitive
content is located . We call this content discovery . For example , you can use a DLP product to scan
your servers So Far Away Twisting by the Pool Skateaway Walk of Life Romeo and Juliet Tunnel of
Love Money for Nothing Sultans of Swing Achilles and identify documents with credit card numbers .
If the server isn't authorized for that kind of data , the file can be encrypted or removed or a warning
sent to the file owner .
